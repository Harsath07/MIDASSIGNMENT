What is the change from normal Jobs (jobs v/s cronJobs)?
Ans:- A Job creates one or more Pods, As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. 
When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. 
Both Jobs & CronJobs does the same thing except CronJob, It runs a job periodically on a given schedule.
